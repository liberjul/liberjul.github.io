<b>I am interesting in exploring the world of microbes and how they impact plants, in order to improve the productivity and sustainability of agriculture and industry, and understand the diversity of life.</b>

As an undergraduate student, I majored in plant biology due to my earlier interest in identifying and understanding the flora around me. During my classes, I also learned to appreciate the variety of other organisms, such as fungi, bacteria, and algae. My first year, I joined Dr. Gregory Bonito's lab. I worked in this lab for the rest of my undergraduate degree and continue to work in the lab as a Master's student. In the lab, I have become interested in studying microbes and their symbiosis with other microbes, plants, viruses, and animals. I also have found that computational tools can provide impressive assistance in measuring and interpreting these systems.

I find that biology is always fascinating, with incredible new questions at every scale and with each organism we study. Because I find biology to be so intriguing, I want to share what I have learned with students and the general public through teaching and outreach. I currently sit on the outreach Committee of the Plant Biology Graduate Student Organization. I hope engagement with science can inspire learners to appreciate the organisms around them and bring scientific thinking to many aspects of their lives.

Outside of my research and outreach, I enjoy a variety of activities such as cooking and baking, gardening, foraging, birdwatching, and spending time outdoors in any way I can.
