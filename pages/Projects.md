## Interactions of bacterial and fungal endophytes with plant disease
<img src="/images/Rhizopus_w_roots.jpg" alt="Rhizopus hyphae and fluorescent Enterobacter on Brachypodium roots" width="300"/>

Bacteria and fungi occupy tissues of plants and can affect phenotypes of their host, often in response to stress. How these communities colonize plant roots with respect to other symbionts and plant disease state is not well explained. Using co-inoculation of bacteria and fungi on <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, and infection with barley yellow dwarf virus, we have worked to explore the factors influencing microbial community assembly.

## Nematode vectoring of fungal endobacteria
<img src="/images/Aphe_avenae_100x.jpg" alt="Aphelenchus avenae on Mortierella hyphae" width="400"/>

Fungal endobacteria of the genus <i>Mycoavidus</i> show evidence of horizontal transfer between fungal lineages. However, the mechanism of this transmission is unknown. Fungivores in soil, such as <i>Aphelenchus</i> nematodes, may be a vector for these endobacteria. So far, we have detected enrichment of endobacterial DNA relative to fungal nuclear DNA in surface sterilized nematodes, compared to fungal tissue. Future work will include visualizing ingested endobacteria and testing transmission via feeding.

## CONSTAXv2: Consensus-based taxonomy assignment for metagenomics
![Classification performance of CONSTAXv2 classifier](/images/speed_and_region_classification_part_cv.png)

With increasing popularity of metagenomics barcoding studies, researchers require high-throughput taxonomic assignment tools to identify taxa or OTUs from NGS reads. CONSTAXv2 implements a consensus approach, using multiple classifiers (SINTAX, RDP, and UTAX or BLAST) to improve performance. Version 2 implements a new BLAST classification approach, with updated software requirements, an easier-to-use implementation, isolate mapping, and SILVA database compatibility.

## Fungal communities of leaf litter
![Barchart of the relative makeup of fungal communities by genus](/images/top30_genera_gg_constax.png)
Decomposition of leaf litter in forest ecosystems largely depends on fungi and is a critical process in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Fungi also live in soil and the tree phyllosphere, but the relative contribution of these communities to the leaf litter is unknown. We used ITS amplicon sequencing to characterize and compare fungal communities in leaf litter, soil, leaf surfaces (epiphytes), and leaf internal tissues (endophytes).

## Comparative genomics of <i>Mycoplasma</i>-related endobacteria (MRE)
![Stacked barchart of proportions of KEGG BRITE annotations for genes](/images/Level2_BRITE_barplot.png)

Fungi in the Mucoromycota are known to have <i>Mycoplasma</i>-related bacteria inhabiting their cells. These bacteria are likely obligate endosymbionts, some with highly reduced genomes, and can have [impacts on host phenotypes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-018-0053-9). We are looking for signatures of endosymbiosis in their genomes, and aim to infer the phylogeny of these symbionts and their hosts. While these symbionts may be
obligate, there may be horizontal transfer between hosts.

## Systematics of Mortierellaceae

Mortierellaceae is a family of globally-distributed fungi often associated with soil, insects, or dung. This is a highly diverse group, with undescribed genera and species. We are working to culture new strains from globally-collected substrates, sequence and characterize these strains, and describe new taxa. Some strains in this group may also be useful for arachidonic acid production, microalgae harvesting, or plant symbiosis.

## Automated phenotyping of filamentous fungi
<video src="/images/tip_tracking_vid.mp4" poster="/images/tip_tracking_poster.jpg" width="600" controls preload></video>

Filamentous fungi are difficult organisms to phenotype, because of the small number of characters which are easily observed. In order to characterize the diversity of groups such as Mortierellaceae, we developed a [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)-based object detection model trained on a manually-curated set of hyphal tip images. This model is accompanied by tools to annotate time-lapse image series infer growth rate by connecting nearest-neighbor annotations between consecutive images.

## Algal-fungal co-culture and flocculation
<img src="/images/Algae_010.jpg" alt="Wild algae captured in Mortierella hyphae" width="600"/>

Microalgae are highly productive photosynthetic organisms which have the potential to make valuable products for food, energy, and other industries. Some species of microalgae adhere to Mortierella hyphae which may be [exploited for harvesting microalgae](https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13068-018-1172-2). We are working to undercover mechanisms of this interaction.
